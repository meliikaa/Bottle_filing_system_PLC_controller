## Working Process

Accurate knowledge of the working process of the bottle filling system was obtained. The flowchart of the project cases was drawn, and the automatic-manual and local-remote work situations were explained.

## Operator Interaction

The operator's role in both automatic-manual and local-remote work situations was detailed. This includes explaining how the operator interacts with the system and controls the bottle filling process.

## Safety Points

All required safety points for the bottle filling system were clarified. These safety points cover emergency stop procedures, safety interlocks, and proper handling of hazardous materials.

## Inputs and Outputs

A comprehensive explanation of the inputs and outputs of the bottle filling system was provided. This includes raw materials, products from another unit, and inputs/outputs received from other departments, specifying their names.

## Additional Items for Failure

Additional components and systems required to handle failures in the bottle filling system were identified. This includes backup power sources, redundant sensors, and fail-safe mechanisms.

## Disturbances and Prioritization

Perceived disturbances in the bottle filling system's performance were demonstrated and prioritized based on their impact on production efficiency and safety.

## Modeling and Simulation

The bottle filling system was modeled and simulated to evaluate its behavior under different conditions. Simulation results were analyzed to optimize system parameters and performance.

## Sensors and Operators

Appropriate sensors and operators were selected for precise control and monitoring of the bottle filling process.

## PID Controller Design

A PID controller was designed for continuous process control to maintain accurate and consistent bottle filling levels.

## Advanced Controller Design

Advanced control techniques, such as fuzzy logic or model predictive control, were considered to improve the bottle filling system's efficiency and reduce errors.

## Dealing with Disorders

Effective solutions were provided to deal with the effects of disorders, such as power outages or water leaks, ensuring minimal disruption to the bottle filling process.

## Foreseeable Defects

Investigation and solutions for foreseeable defects in the performance of both automatic and manual cases, such as equipment malfunctions, were addressed.

## PLC Selection

The appropriate PLC for controlling the bottle filling system was chosen based on its specifications and compatibility with the control requirements.

## PLC Program Structure

The structure of the PLC program was explained, defining the required modules to achieve optimal control logic.

## PLC Programming

PLC program modules were coded, either specifically for the project or in a generic form using common PLC programming languages, to implement the control strategies and logic effectively.
